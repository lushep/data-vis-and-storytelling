    "We have looked at the main different types of chart one can use when plotting information. It is important to be extremely comfortable with these chart types first before we start using more complex solutions for chart types. This means we can start adding more story telling elements (People, Plot and Purpose) to really control and aid the story that's being told. Once we have confidence in that we can start to look at more complicated chart types.\n",
