Vega-Lite specifications are expressed in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), a cross-platform format often used for storage of nested and/or hierarchical data. Altair builds a Python layer on top of this, so that rather than writing raw JSON strings the user can write declarative Python code.\n",

    "When the number of rows in your dataset exceeds 5000, altair will return a `MaxRowsError`. This is not because Altair cannot handle larger datasets, but it is because it is important for the user to think carefully about how large datasets are handled. Altair typically leads to relatively large notebooks, even with smaller datasets. It is quite easy to end up with very large notebooks of you make many visualisations of a large dataset, and this error is a way of preventing that.\n",
